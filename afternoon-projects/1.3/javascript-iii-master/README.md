# javascript-iii

This project contains a lot of problems because we would like you to push yourselves as much as possible. In a standard DM afternoon block (3-4 hours), it is expected that you can complete 2 problems in each of the following files:

- nesting.js
- destructuring.js
- higher-order.js
- forInLoops_Delete.js
- classes.js

If you complete these ahead of time, please work on the additional problems. Otherwise, feel free to move on to other content.

Run live-server, edit the forInLoops_Delete.js, nesting.js, destructuring.js, higher-order.js, and classes.js files.  Live-server has links to the 4 spec runners for each module.
